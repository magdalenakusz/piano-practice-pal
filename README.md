## 🎨 Customization

### Adjust Daily Scale Count

Edit `services/practiceService.ts`:

```typescript
const NUM_DAILY_SCALES = 2; // Change to your preferred number
```

### Modify Selection Algorithm

The scale selection algorithm in `practiceService.ts` considers:
- **Confidence level**: Lower confidence = higher priority
- **Days since last practice**: Longer time = higher priority
- **Randomness**: Small random factor for variety

Adjust the weights to customize behavior:

```typescript
const confidenceWeight = (4 - entry.confidence) * 20;
const recencyWeight = daysSincePracticed;
const randomFactor = Math.random() * 5;
```
